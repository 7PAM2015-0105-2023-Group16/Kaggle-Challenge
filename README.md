# Kaggle challenge
This Kaggle-Challenge build a predictive model to determine which passenger from a hypothetical spaceship were transported to an alternate dimension based on spaceship titanic dataset.
In our first attempt we got a point 0.Then in second attempts we used Random forest and we got a point 0.78816.


In order to get higher value we tried in our 3rd attempt Gradiant booster model that gave us the value 0.7611 which is much better than previous model
